# SICP  
Short for the magic book < Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs >

## Here is the place I keep and display my practices for SICP  
This site gives me a lot of help when trying to find how to use Drracket
[wizardbook.wordpress.com](https://wizardbook.wordpress.com/2010/12/25/exercise-4-3/)

## Most of the practice done here is tested with drracket  
with the `#lang planet neil/sicp`,  
some with `#lang racket` or `#lang sicp`,  
if without `#lang` line, 
I am setting the language to SICP in the left corner
(it only shows up if you have ran `#lang planet neil/sicp` before).
