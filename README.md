[Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](http://sarabander.github.io/sicp/html/index.xhtml#SEC_Contents)  
Here is the place I keep and display my practices for SICP  

## Credit and resources
* [wizardbook.wordpress.com](https://wizardbook.wordpress.com/2010/12/25/exercise-4-3/): nice site helping you do sicp exercise on drracket

## Environment
Most of the practice done here is tested with drracket 
* meta header `#lang planet neil/sicp`,  
* some with `#lang racket` or `#lang sicp`,  
* if without `#lang` line, I am setting the language to SICP in the left corner (it only shows up if you have ran `#lang planet neil/sicp` before).
